# hangman
simple CLI hangman game
The simple command line game was a fun challenge . It took a lot of tinkering to get the logic just right One of the key breakthroughs was learning how to use a loop to manage repeated guesses and game progressions. I did find some inspiration online from other source codes to help me and i implemented in my own way. I also discovered how powerful list comprehensions are
The if statements are pretty straightforward once you get it down and it was an overall a great learning experience to enhance my critical thinking and problem solving skills.
